Using Hebi X series, we can get Gyro sensor value by using this python code. We can check it from ipynb file. 
Note that we have to fix hebi actuator's family and group name. 
At first, Download and install hebi scope api to your pc. 
Next, connect the hardwere with power supply and internet. 
Finally, check the name. e.g. Family name : X5-9 Group name: wheel_01  
By following all these steps, please check it from scope. We can check position, velocity, efforts...etc. 
Now, run python code and check it. Please, remember that wifi is connected with your pc and hardwere in a same SSN. Thanks!
